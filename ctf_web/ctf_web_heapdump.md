A heap dump on the web typically refers to exposing or leaking a heap memory snapshot of a running web application (usually in Java) via a web-accessible endpoint. This is dangerous and can lead to serious security risks like leaking credentials, sessions, and sensitive data.

üß† What Is a Heap Dump?
A heap dump is a snapshot of the memory used by a program (especially the heap segment, where objects are stored).

It contains all live objects at the time of the snapshot‚Äîthis includes:

User sessions

Credentials

Cookies

Database connection strings

Internal application data

1. üï≥Ô∏è Heap Dump Exposed via Web Endpoint
Some Java web applications (e.g., using Spring Boot or JMX) allow endpoints like:


http://example.com/heapdump
http://example.com/actuator/heapdump
If not secured, anyone can download the heap dump.

2. üß™ How an Attacker Abuses This
If /heapdump is exposed publicly:

*Attacker downloads the .hprof file (Java heap format).

*Opens it in tools like:

*Eclipse MAT (Memory Analyzer Tool)

*VisualVM

*IntelliJ Profiler

Searches for:

*password

*Authorization

*Token

*Database URIs

*Email/PII data


here in this particular case 
we apply heapdump at api docs and it gives us a readable file 
so we cat it in terminal and then grep for "picoCTF"
